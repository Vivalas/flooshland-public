</I></FONT><P>So, you just joined the game. Amazing. Flooshland is a game of adventure, exploration, and discovery. All suggestions go to Rogue Forums. Click an object to move it to your square. Right-Click it and pick it up to move it into your inventory. All objects have many options, many for you to figure out. You must equip weapons to use them. Once a weapon is equipped Double Click (for melee) or Click (for ranged weapons) a target to shoot. Fun, right? Axes can be used to cut down trees, which gives you wood to build with. You can also plant seeds from trees. If you eat grass, it will reveal dirt. Amazing. Flooshes are amazing. They have unique digestive tracks. Eat some dirt to bore into the depths below and explore. Above all explore. There are many unexpected things awaiting you.</P></BODY>
